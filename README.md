Investigated the relations between biomechanical attributes as predictors with developing vertebral column diseases like Disc hernia or Spondylolisthesis

During the last decade, modern numerical methods and machine learning techniques like gradient boosting, bagging, random forest, trees, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks have been applied vastly in many medical fields like cardiology, oncology, radiology, pathology, neurology genetic, biochemistry and etc. These methods by providing a reliable prediction models, can be helpful improving the disease diagnosis. Many studies have investigated different learning models and compared their efficiency and robustness in application.

The aim of this study is investigating and comparing the relations between biomechanical attributes as predictors with developing vertebral column diseases like Disc hernia or Spondylolisthesis, using statistical teqniques Random Forest and Boosting (AdaBoostM1). Then the performance and model fit of these methods will be compared to assess which one could be more successful explaining the data with less error.
