The vertebral column is included a group of vertebras, invertebrate discs, nerves, muscles, medulla and joints. 
There are three main functions for vertebral column: first it helps for body support axle, second it acts as a 
protector of spine medulla and nervous roots and finally it helps for body movement axle. 
Disc hernia is a disease that occurs when core of the inter-vertebral disc migrates from its
place in the center of the disc to the border parts like the medullarly channel or to the spaces 
where the nervous roots lie. Spondylolisthesis disease appears when one of the 33 vertebras slips in relation to the others. 
This slipping can cause pain or irritation of the nervous roots. 
There are some biomedical attributes like pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, 
pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis which are recognized to be related with developing Disc hernia and 
Spondylolisthesis.
