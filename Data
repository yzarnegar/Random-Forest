The database used in this work is Vertebral Column Data Set provided by Dr. 
Henrique da Mota during a medical residence period in the Group of Applied Research at the Centre of 
Medico-Chirurgical de Readaptation des Massues, Lyon, France. 

This database which has obtained from sagittal panoramic radiographies of the spinecontains, 
contains 100 patients who are volunteers without having any pathology in their spines (controls or normal patients),
59 patients were operated due to disc hernia and 150 patients were operated due to spondylolisthesis. 
In this database, each patient is represented by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation
of the pelvis and lumbar spine: pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic 
radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. The outcome variable is categorical with three classes for existence of 
any pathology in tspines. The class labels are: DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB) [5].
